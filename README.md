# Article Extractor üì∞

This API automatically extracts the main content of an article from any website using the Mozilla Readability library. It's ideal for anyone who wants to obtain only the relevant text from news pages, blogs, or editorial portals, removing ads and unnecessary content.

4. **Usage:**
